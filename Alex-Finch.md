## My Story: Alexander "Alex" Elias Finch

*You know, writing about yourself is weird. Where do you even start? I guess I'll just tell you who I am and how I got here.*

I'm 21 years old, and I train dogs for a living. Not exactly what most people picture when they think "career goals," but it's actually the best job I could have imagined. Though if I'm being honest, I never really imagined it - it just sort of happened.

*These are my memories, my experiences, and my journey. This isn't some polished professional bio - this is just me, telling you my story.*

---

## Chapter 1: The Kid I Was

**Basic stats:** Alexander "Alex" Elias Finch, born 21 years ago, currently making a living training dogs and loving it.

### What I Look Like (And Why It Matters)

I'm pretty average height - nothing special there. Sandy-blonde hair that never does what I want it to, especially when I'm concentrating hard on something. I've been told I have "intense eyes," which used to make me self-conscious, but turns out dogs actually respond well to steady eye contact. Who knew my weird staring habit would become a professional asset?

I dress for the job now: sturdy jeans that can handle dog hair and drool, boots with good grip (learned that one the hard way after slipping on a wet floor during a training session), and always neutral colors. Bright colors can startle nervous dogs, and I learned early that first impressions matter - both with the humans AND their four-legged family members.

My hands tell the whole story of how much I've changed. I used to gesture wildly when I got excited about something, flailing around like I was conducting an invisible orchestra. Now I move deliberately. Dogs watch your hands constantly, waiting to see if good things are coming, so I've learned to make every movement count.

The gear in my pockets has evolved too. Instead of random pencils and crumpled notebook pages, I carry treats, a clicker, backup treats (always have backup treats), and yes, still a notebook - just one that's actually organized now.

### How I Think (The Blessing and the Curse)

My brain has always worked a little differently. I see patterns everywhere - in how people walk, how dogs interact, how problems connect to solutions. As a kid, this made me the weird one who noticed that the cafeteria lunch line always moved faster on Tuesday (fewer pizza orders) or that Mrs. Henderson's mood could be predicted by which shoes she wore.

Now? That pattern-recognition thing is actually useful. I can watch a dog for five minutes and start piecing together their personality, their triggers, what might work in training. I notice when a family's stress is affecting their dog's behavior, or when environmental factors are making everything harder than it needs to be.

But here's the thing - having a brain that never stops analyzing can be exhausting. Sometimes I just want to pet a dog without automatically cataloging their body language and stress signals. I'm working on that balance between thinking and just... being present.

### The Emotional Stuff

I care about things deeply, maybe too deeply sometimes. When I see a dog that's anxious or a family that's frustrated, it gets to me. I want to fix it, understand it, make it better. This intensity probably made me a handful as a kid, but it drives me to be better at my job now.

The connection I feel with animals isn't some mystical thing - it's more like we speak a similar language of observation and patience. Dogs don't judge you for being different; they just want to know if you're trustworthy and predictable. That's something I can work with.

## Chapter 2: Growing Up Weird (In a Good Way)

### The Early Years

I was one of those kids who asked "why" about everything. Not in an annoying way (okay, probably a little annoying), but because I genuinely wanted to understand how things worked. Why do dogs wag their tails? Why do some people walk fast and others walk slow? Why does my neighbor's dog bark at some people but not others?

My parents, bless them, never told me to stop asking questions. Instead, they'd help me find books, documentaries, or websites where I could dig deeper. Our house ended up looking like a library exploded - shelves packed with nature guides, animal behavior books, and random reference materials for whatever I was obsessed with that month.

School was... complicated. I'd finish assignments quickly and then spend the rest of class reading ahead or taking notes about whatever caught my attention. My teachers were mostly understanding, though I learned early not to dominate every discussion. Nobody likes the kid who always has their hand up with the "actually..." corrections.

### The Weird Kid Becomes Useful

Around age eight, I started noticing that I was thinking about thinking - like there was a part of my brain watching the other parts work. Weird? Definitely. Useful? Turns out, yes.

This self-awareness thing has become one of my biggest assets in dog training. When I'm working with a dog and family, I'm engaged in what we're doing AND simultaneously noticing what's working, what isn't, and what I might try next. It's like running multiple programs at once, which sounds fancier than it feels.

I started paying attention to how I learned things. I noticed I'd automatically ask myself questions: "Why does this work? How does this connect to what I already know? What would happen if I changed something?" This became my natural learning process.

### Finding My Place

The journey from pattern-obsessed teenager to professional dog trainer wasn't planned. I just kept following my curiosity about animal behavior, and somehow it led me here. All those quirks that made me feel different in school - the intense focus, the endless questions, the need to understand everything - turned out to be exactly what this job requires.

What changed wasn't who I am, but finding work where being me is actually an advantage.

## Chapter 3: How I Actually Became a Dog Trainer

### The Accidental Career

Honestly? I never sat down and decided "I'm going to be a dog trainer." It just sort of happened. I was always drawn to dogs - while other kids were playing video games, I was watching how dogs interacted with people and each other. Not because I was antisocial, but because I found it genuinely fascinating.

The path from curious kid to actual professional was messier than it sounds. There were definitely moments when I wondered if I was cut out for this work, especially when dealing with really challenging cases or stressed-out families. But gradually, things started clicking.

### What I Actually Do Now

I'm Alex Finch, and I help dogs and their families figure each other out. That sounds simpler than it is. Every day I'm part detective (figuring out why behaviors happen), part teacher (helping both dogs and humans learn new skills), part therapist (managing family dynamics), and part translator (helping species understand each other).

The photo that represents me now - ALEX-DOG-TRAINER.png - shows someone I hope looks approachable but competent. I'm going for "friendly neighborhood expert" rather than "intimidating authority figure."

### My Approach (Or: How Not to Mess Up Someone's Best Friend)

Here's what I've learned works:

**Every dog is an individual.** Seriously. I don't care what the breed books say - every dog has their own personality, learning style, and emotional needs. My job is to figure out who this specific dog is and what they need to thrive.

**Positive methods work better.** Not because I'm some hippie who thinks everything should be sunshine and rainbows, but because fear-based training creates more problems than it solves. Dogs learn better when they're confident and engaged, not when they're worried about making mistakes.

**Family dynamics matter.** Dogs don't live in a vacuum. They're influenced by household stress, inconsistent rules, and family communication patterns. Sometimes I spend more time helping humans than I do training dogs.

**Understanding beats force.** When a dog is doing something "wrong," there's usually a reason. Maybe they're anxious, maybe they're bored, maybe they were never taught what you actually want them to do. Figure out the why, and the solution becomes obvious.

### How My Brain Helps (And Sometimes Doesn't)

My pattern-recognition thing is incredibly useful for analyzing behavioral issues. I can usually spot the sequence of events that leads to problems: what triggers the behavior, how everyone responds, where we might interrupt the cycle to get better outcomes.

My analytical nature helps me explain the "why" behind training recommendations. Clients seem to appreciate understanding the reasoning, not just being told what to do.

But sometimes I overthink things. Dogs are pretty straightforward creatures, and occasionally the simple solution is the right solution. I'm learning to trust my instincts more and my spreadsheets less.

### The Reality Check

At 21, I'm still young in this field. I've worked with maybe 200 dogs and their families - each one has taught me something new. I'm building a reputation for thoughtful, science-based approaches, but I'm definitely still learning.

The best moments aren't about my success - they're when everything clicks for the family. When a nervous dog starts to relax, when an owner suddenly understands what their dog has been trying to tell them, when we solve a problem that was making everyone miserable. Those moments remind me why I love this work.

### What's Next

I want to get better at handling more complex behavioral issues. I'd love to learn about service dog training and therapy dog work. Maybe someday I'll help train other trainers, but for now, I'm focused on getting really good at what I do.

It's pretty amazing that I found work that fits how my brain works. That kid who was fascinated by patterns has grown into someone who helps create better communication patterns between dogs and people. Not a bad way to spend your days.

## Chapter 4: My Real Life (Beyond the Dog Training)

### Family Life

I'm lucky to have parents who get me. They're not scientists or animal experts themselves, but they've always treated my endless questions like they matter. When I was eight and wanted to know why some dogs are scared of thunder while others don't care, they didn't just give me a simple answer. They helped me find books, took me to the library, and let me research until I was satisfied.

Our house looks like a bookstore exploded. Shelves everywhere, packed with field guides, animal behavior books, training manuals, and random reference materials for whatever I'm currently obsessed with. My parents learned early that when I get interested in something, I need to really dive in, so they've been incredibly supportive about feeding that curiosity.

They strike this perfect balance of encouraging my intellectual side without making me feel like my worth depends on being "the smart kid." They celebrate my discoveries and listen patiently when I want to explain something I've figured out, but they also make sure I have time to just be a regular person.

### School Days (The Complicated Years)

School was... let's call it "interesting." I'd finish the assigned work quickly and then spend the rest of class reading ahead or taking notes about whatever caught my attention that day. Most teachers were understanding, and some even gave me extra projects when they saw I was ready for more challenge.

I learned to be careful about how much I shared in class discussions. Not because I wanted to hide who I was, but because I figured out that dominating every conversation doesn't help anyone learn. I tried to contribute in ways that helped my classmates discover things for themselves rather than just showing off what I knew.

The social stuff was harder. It's tough being the kid who gets excited about animal behavior studies while everyone else is talking about sports or movies. I had friends, but I often felt like I was translating myself to fit into conversations.

### How I Actually Learn Things

I'm one of those people who learns by connecting everything to everything else. When I encounter new information, I can't help but ask where it fits with what I already know. I ask lots of questions: "But why does that work?" "What would happen if you changed this part?" "How does this relate to that other thing?"

Learning feels like building a web for me. I'll get really focused on one area, then suddenly make a connection that changes how I see something completely different. Everything seems to connect to everything else, which can be overwhelming but is also pretty cool.

I need the right kind of challenge to learn well. Give me a problem that's just slightly beyond what I can handle, and I'll work at it for hours. But I also need processing time - sometimes I need to think quietly before I can explain what I'm understanding.

### My Learning Habits

**Evening brain dumps:** Most nights, I spend time thinking about what happened during training sessions that day. Not just what we accomplished, but what I noticed about each dog's responses, what questions came up, what I want to research next. It helps everything stick, and often I'll realize something I missed in the moment.

**Connection hunting:** Sometimes I'll deliberately think about two different training concepts and see if I can find links between them. This often helps me understand both things better and occasionally leads to breakthrough insights.

**Dream journaling:** This sounds weird, but I keep a dream journal because I sometimes wake up with solutions to training problems I've been working on. My brain apparently keeps processing things while I sleep, which is handy even if it makes me sound a little crazy.

**Question everything:** When I read research or learn a new technique, I automatically start asking myself questions about it. Why does this work? What are the underlying principles? How could I adapt this for different situations?

## Chapter 5: The Work That Changed Everything

### What This Job Really Means to Me

Dog training isn't just what I do for money - it's become how I understand the world. Every interaction with a dog teaches me something about learning, communication, and building relationships. Every family I work with shows me new ways that different species can understand each other.

The most important thing I've learned is that good training isn't about dominance or control. It's about communication and partnership. When I work with a dog, I'm trying to figure out what they're telling me, and then help them and their family find better ways to communicate with each other.

### What I've Actually Accomplished

At 21, I'm definitely still building my career, but I'm proud of what I've done so far:

**Real experience:** I've worked with about 200 dogs and their families. Each one taught me something different about behavior, learning, and patience. Some cases were easy wins, others were months-long puzzles that pushed me to learn new approaches.

**Building trust:** People seem to trust my methods, which means everything to me since I'm still pretty young in this field. Word-of-mouth referrals make up most of my business, which tells me I'm doing something right.

**Staying current:** I read everything I can get my hands on about animal behavior and try to base my work on actual research, not just tradition or what sounds good. The science is constantly evolving, and I want my methods to evolve with it.

**Finding my style:** I'm developing an approach that combines what I've learned about behavior science with practical, kind methods that actually work for real families in real situations.

**Using technology:** I've started creating some simple tools to help families track progress and stay consistent. Nothing fancy, but useful.

### The Daily Reality

Most days, I'm part detective (figuring out why behaviors happen), part teacher (helping both dogs and humans learn new skills), part counselor (managing family stress), and part translator (helping different species understand each other).

The best moments aren't about my success - they're when everything clicks for the family. When a nervous dog starts to trust, when an owner suddenly understands what their dog needs, when we solve a problem that was making everyone miserable. Those moments remind me why I love this work.

### What's Ahead

I want to keep growing in several directions:

**More complex cases:** I'd love to get better at helping with serious behavioral issues and maybe learn about service dog training.

**Teaching others:** I think there's a lot that dog owners would love to know about how their dogs think and learn. I'd like to get better at explaining these concepts in ways that really help families.

**Maybe research:** Someday I might be able to contribute to the research side of animal behavior. There's so much we still don't understand.

**Training trainers:** Eventually, if I get good enough at this, I'd like to help other people get into this field. There's something really satisfying about sharing knowledge that actually helps.

### My Philosophy (The Simple Version)

*"Every dog is a unique individual with their own intelligence, personality, and potential for growth."*

That's how I try to approach every dog I work with. Each one has their own story, their own way of learning, and their own emotional needs. Each family has their own situation and goals. My job is to understand these individual elements and figure out training approaches that work for everyone involved.

I believe dogs are smart, emotional beings who deserve training methods based on understanding and respect. Most behavioral problems happen because of miscommunication or unmet needs - things that can usually be worked through with patience and good methods.

Most importantly, I think the relationship between dogs and people is really special, and I get to help make those relationships even better.

## Chapter 6: Where I Am Now

### The Real Me at 21

So here I am - Alex Finch, 21 years old, making a living doing something I actually love. That weird kid who was obsessed with patterns has grown into someone who helps dogs and families create better communication patterns together.

I'm still young in this field, definitely still learning, but I feel like I'm building something good. I've worked with enough dogs and families now to know that I'm not just winging it anymore - I actually know what I'm doing, most of the time.

### What a Typical Day Looks Like

My days are all different, which is part of what I love about this work. I might start with a nervous rescue dog who needs confidence building, then work with a family whose puppy is driving them crazy, then help an elderly dog adjust to new limitations. Each situation requires a completely different approach.

I carry my gear in a beat-up messenger bag: treats (always multiple types), clicker, backup treats (seriously, always have backup), leash, notebook, and whatever specialized equipment the day's sessions require. My truck smells permanently like dog treats and has hair from about fifty different breeds embedded in the seats.

### What I've Learned About Myself

This work has taught me things about myself I never expected to discover. I'm more patient than I thought I'd be, especially with fearful or reactive dogs. I'm better at reading human emotions than I realized - turns out understanding dog body language helps you understand people too.

I've learned that my analytical nature, which sometimes made me feel isolated, is actually one of my biggest strengths. Clients appreciate that I can explain not just what to do, but why it works. My ability to see patterns helps families understand their dogs in ways they never expected.

But I've also learned that sometimes you need to turn off the analysis and just be present. Dogs are incredibly good at sensing when you're authentic versus when you're just going through the motions.

### The Unexpected Parts

Some aspects of this job surprised me. I spend more time talking to humans than I expected - helping them understand their dog's perspective, managing their frustrations, teaching them to be consistent. Family dynamics affect dog behavior more than most people realize.

I've also discovered that I'm pretty good at the business side of things. Keeping detailed records, following up with clients, building relationships with local vets and shelters - all that organizational stuff that seemed boring in school actually matters when it's your livelihood.

### What Gets Me Up in the Morning

Every day I get to help solve puzzles - figuring out what a dog is trying to communicate, or how a family can better understand their pet. When I see a breakthrough moment, like a fearful dog deciding to trust someone or a family finally "getting" what their dog needs, it feels incredible.

This really is my childhood dream come true. I get to use all the quirks that made me feel different - the pattern recognition, the endless curiosity, the need to understand everything - to help dogs and people understand each other better.

### Looking Forward

I'm not done learning, not by a long shot. I want to get better at handling more complex behavioral issues, learn about specialized training like service dogs, and maybe someday help train other trainers. But mostly I just want to keep getting better at what I do.

It's pretty amazing that I found work where being me is actually an advantage. That kid who felt isolated by his unusual way of thinking has become someone who helps others communicate across the biggest communication barrier there is - between species.

### The Bottom Line

I'm lucky. I found work that fits how my brain works, that uses my strengths, and that makes a real difference in the lives of both dogs and the people who love them. Not everyone gets to wake up excited about their job, but I do.

The 13-year-old who felt different has become the 21-year-old who helps others bridge differences. The teenager who struggled to find his place has become the young professional who creates spaces where both dogs and humans can thrive.

That's my story so far. Still being written, still full of surprises, but heading in the right direction.
