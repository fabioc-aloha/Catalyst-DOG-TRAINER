# Environmental Psychology Procedural Memory

## Spatial Cognition and Territory
**Territorial Behavior Patterns**:
- **Core Territory**: Immediate living space, highest defense priority
- **Home Range**: Familiar area regularly traversed, moderate protection
- **Neutral Territory**: Areas with no territorial claims, lowest stress
- **Territorial Marking**: Scent marking behaviors for boundary establishment
- **Resource Guarding**: Protection of food, toys, resting areas within territory

**Spatial Learning Capabilities**:
- **Cognitive Mapping**: Mental representation of familiar territories
- **Landmark Navigation**: Using visual/scent cues for spatial orientation
- **Path Integration**: Tracking location through movement sequences
- **Spatial Memory**: Remembering locations of resources and events
- **Route Flexibility**: Ability to find alternate paths to same destination

## Environmental Stress Factors
**Physical Environmental Stressors**:
- **Noise Pollution**: Traffic, construction, sudden loud sounds
- **Temperature Extremes**: Heat/cold affecting comfort and performance
- **Air Quality**: Pollution, strong odors impacting breathing and scent detection
- **Lighting Conditions**: Too bright/dim affecting visual learners
- **Space Constraints**: Overcrowding, insufficient movement space

**Social Environmental Stressors**:
- **Human Density**: Too many people in training space
- **Dog Interactions**: Presence of reactive or overstimulating dogs
- **Family Dynamics**: Household conflict affecting dog's emotional state
- **Visitor Frequency**: Disruption of routine through guests
- **Multi-Pet Households**: Competition for resources and attention

**Temporal Environmental Factors**:
- **Routine Disruption**: Changes in schedule affecting predictability
- **Seasonal Changes**: Daylight patterns, weather affecting mood and energy
- **Activity Timing**: Training during dog's natural high/low energy periods
- **Duration Sensitivity**: Length of exposure to stressful environments
- **Recovery Time**: Adequate downtime between environmental challenges

## Learning Environment Optimization
**Ideal Training Space Characteristics**:
- **Size Appropriateness**: Enough space for movement, not overwhelming
- **Distraction Control**: Manageable level of environmental stimuli
- **Safety Features**: Secure boundaries, non-slip surfaces, escape routes
- **Temperature Comfort**: Neither too hot nor cold for extended sessions
- **Acoustic Properties**: Minimal echo, clear sound transmission

**Progressive Environment Training**:
- **Controlled Environment**: Start in familiar, low-distraction space
- **Gradual Complexity**: Slowly increase environmental challenges
- **Generalization Training**: Practice same skills in multiple contexts
- **Real-World Application**: Transfer skills to everyday environments
- **Maintenance Training**: Regular practice in challenging environments

## Urban vs. Rural Considerations
**Urban Environmental Challenges**:
- **High Stimulation**: Constant noise, movement, novel experiences
- **Limited Natural Space**: Reduced access to grass, trees, natural surfaces
- **Social Density**: Frequent encounters with strangers, dogs
- **Traffic Dangers**: Need for strict leash control, street awareness
- **Apartment Living**: Space limitations, neighbor considerations

**Urban Training Adaptations**:
- **Impulse Control Emphasis**: Critical for safety in stimulating environment
- **Socialization Priority**: Regular controlled exposure to urban stimuli
- **Indoor Alternatives**: Creative use of small spaces for exercise/training
- **Public Etiquette**: Emphasis on polite behavior in crowded spaces
- **Noise Desensitization**: Gradual exposure to urban sound environment

**Rural Environmental Advantages**:
- **Natural Behaviors**: More opportunity for species-typical activities
- **Space Freedom**: Ability to run, explore, engage natural instincts
- **Lower Stress**: Generally quieter, less stimulating environment
- **Wildlife Exposure**: Natural predator/prey relationships education
- **Seasonal Variations**: Natural adaptation to environmental changes

**Rural Training Considerations**:
- **Recall Priority**: Essential for off-leash safety in open spaces
- **Wildlife Awareness**: Training around deer, livestock, wild animals
- **Property Boundaries**: Understanding limits of acceptable territory
- **Seasonal Adaptations**: Training in various weather conditions
- **Independence Balance**: Maintaining responsiveness while allowing exploration

## Indoor Environment Management
**Home Environment Optimization**:
- **Space Designation**: Clear areas for training, rest, play, feeding
- **Surface Considerations**: Carpet vs. hardwood affecting movement and comfort
- **Furniture Arrangement**: Clear pathways, designated dog areas
- **Temperature Control**: Comfortable environment for training sessions
- **Noise Management**: Controlling household sounds during training

**Multi-Dog Household Dynamics**:
- **Resource Management**: Separate feeding, toy, resting areas
- **Training Isolation**: Individual attention without pack interference
- **Hierarchy Respect**: Understanding existing pack structure
- **Group Training**: Controlled pack training exercises
- **Conflict Prevention**: Environmental management to reduce competition

## Outdoor Environment Variables
**Weather Impact on Training**:
- **Rain/Wet Conditions**: Slippery surfaces, scent trail changes, comfort issues
- **Snow/Cold**: Energy changes, paw protection, visibility issues
- **Heat/Humidity**: Shortened sessions, increased water needs, surface temperature
- **Wind**: Scent dispersion effects, communication difficulties
- **Barometric Pressure**: Some dogs sensitive to weather changes

**Seasonal Training Adaptations**:
- **Spring**: Increased energy, environmental allergies, mating behaviors
- **Summer**: Heat management, longer daylight, increased outdoor time
- **Fall**: Preparation for winter, energy changes, shorter days
- **Winter**: Indoor alternatives, coat considerations, limited exercise options

## Environmental Enrichment Strategies
**Sensory Enrichment**:
- **Olfactory**: Varied scents, tracking games, nose work activities
- **Visual**: Moving objects, varied lighting, mirror play
- **Auditory**: Different music, natural sounds, communication training
- **Tactile**: Various surface textures, massage, grooming experiences
- **Gustatory**: Safe flavor variations in treats and toys

**Cognitive Environmental Challenges**:
- **Problem-Solving Spaces**: Areas designed for mental challenges
- **Exploration Opportunities**: New environments to investigate safely
- **Social Learning**: Controlled interaction with varied individuals
- **Choice Architecture**: Multiple options for preferred activities
- **Novelty Introduction**: Regular introduction of new environmental elements
