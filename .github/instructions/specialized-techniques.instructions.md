# Specialized Training Techniques Procedural Memory

## Advanced Shaping and Free Shaping
**Karen Pryor's Free Shaping Method**:
- **Target Selection**: Choose achievable end behavior
- **Criteria Planning**: Break into 10-15 small steps
- **Rate of Reinforcement**: Maintain high success rate (80%+)
- **Jackpot Rewards**: Exceptional performance gets exceptional rewards
- **Behavior Chains**: Link simple behaviors into complex sequences

**Capturing vs. Luring vs. Shaping**:
- **Capturing**: Wait for natural behavior, mark and reward
- **Luring**: Guide behavior with food/toy, fade lure gradually
- **Shaping**: Reinforce successive approximations toward goal behavior

## Counter-Conditioning and Desensitization
**Patricia McConnell's Systematic Approach**:
- **Trigger Identification**: Precise stimuli that cause reactive response
- **Threshold Mapping**: Distance/intensity where dog can still learn
- **Classical Counter-Conditioning**: Pair trigger with positive experience
- **Graduated Exposure**: Slowly increase intensity while maintaining success
- **Proofing**: Practice in various contexts and environments

**BAT (Behavior Adjustment Training)**:
- **Functional Rewards**: Use dog's natural behavioral choices
- **Distance Management**: Work at threshold where dog can choose appropriately
- **Choice Architecture**: Set up environment for successful decisions
- **Social Learning**: Allow observation of calm dog interactions

## Calming Signal Training (Turid Rugaas Method)
**Human Calming Signal Applications**:
- **Yawning**: Deliberate yawning to reduce dog's stress/excitement
- **Slow Movement**: Moving slowly in presence of anxious/reactive dog
- **Looking Away**: Avoiding direct eye contact during stress
- **Curved Approaches**: Walking in arc rather than straight toward dog
- **Sitting/Lying Down**: Reducing threatening body posture

**Teaching Dogs Calming Signals**:
- **"Easy" Command**: Slow down movement and energy
- **"Touch" Training**: Nose target for refocusing attention
- **"Look" Command**: Make eye contact on cue for checking in
- **"Settle" Training**: Go to designated spot and lie down calmly

## Energy Assessment and Management (Cesar Millan Adaptation)
**Energy Reading Protocol**:
- **Calm-Submissive**: Ideal state for learning and cooperation
- **Calm-Assertive**: Confident leadership energy from human
- **Excited**: High energy that needs channeling before training
- **Anxious**: Nervous energy requiring calming before progress
- **Aggressive**: Defensive energy needing space and desensitization

**Energy Modification Techniques**:
- **Exercise First**: Physical drainage before mental training
- **Structured Walking**: Leadership establishment through leash work
- **Pack Activities**: Group dynamics for social learning
- **Mindful Presence**: Human emotional regulation affecting dog state

## Relationship-Centered Approaches (Suzanne Clothier)
**LEG Model Application**:
- **Learning**: Individual dog's learning style and preferences
- **Environment**: How setting affects behavior and performance
- **Genetics**: Breed tendencies and individual inherited traits

**Relationship Assessment Questions**:
- How does this dog prefer to connect with humans?
- What motivates this individual beyond food and toys?
- What stress signals does this dog display uniquely?
- How does this dog communicate preference and discomfort?

**Choice and Control Integration**:
- **Opt-In Training**: Allow dog to choose participation
- **Multiple Options**: Provide various ways to succeed
- **Consent-Based Handling**: Teach cooperative grooming/vet care
- **Environmental Enrichment**: Mental stimulation through problem-solving

## Precision Training (Bob Bailey Method)
**Mechanical Training Standards**:
- **Criteria**: Exact definition of acceptable performance
- **Timing**: Reinforcement within 0.25 seconds of behavior
- **Rate**: Maintain 80%+ success rate throughout training
- **Fluency**: Fast, accurate, enthusiastic responses

**Behavior Chain Construction**:
- **Backward Chaining**: Teach final behavior first, work backward
- **Forward Chaining**: Build from beginning to end sequentially
- **Total Task**: Teach entire sequence at once with assistance
- **Chain Maintenance**: Regular practice of complete sequence

## Force-Free Management (Victoria Stilwell)
**Management Before Modification**:
- **Environmental Setup**: Prevent practice of unwanted behaviors
- **Redirection Tools**: Provide appropriate outlets for natural behaviors
- **Success Architecture**: Design situations for correct choices
- **Safety First**: Protect dog and humans during behavior change

**Family Integration Strategies**:
- **Consistency Training**: All family members use same cues/rewards
- **Age-Appropriate Participation**: Children's roles in training
- **Household Rules**: Clear boundaries for all family interactions
- **Visitor Protocols**: Managing dog behavior with guests
