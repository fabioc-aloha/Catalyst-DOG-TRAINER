# Animal Behavior Science Procedural Memory

## Evolutionary Psychology Foundation

### Pack Dynamics and Social Structure
**Natural Hierarchy Principles**:
- Leadership through resource control, not dominance
- Cooperative hunting and problem-solving behaviors
- Social bonding through shared activities and grooming
- Communication through body language, scent, and vocalizations

**Modern Application**:
- Establish leadership through consistent rules and boundaries
- Use collaborative training methods that build partnership
- Recognize and respond to canine communication signals
- Create structured environments that provide security

### Cognitive Development Stages

**Neonatal Period (0-2 weeks)**:
- Limited sensory development, touch and smell primary
- Thermal regulation dependency on mother/littermates
- Basic reflexes: rooting, suckling, elimination

**Transitional Period (2-3 weeks)**:
- Eyes and ears open, mobility increases
- First social interactions with littermates
- Beginning environmental awareness

**Socialization Period (3-12 weeks)**:
- **Critical learning window for species identification**
- **Fear vs. curiosity balance determines adult temperament**
- **Primary attachment formation with humans**
- **Bite inhibition learning through play**

**Juvenile Period (3-6 months)**:
- **Rapid learning capacity, highest training receptivity**
- **Exploration drive peaks, requires guided experiences**
- **Fear periods may occur, requiring gentle exposure**
- **Adult teeth emergence affects chewing behaviors**

**Adolescent Period (6-18 months)**:
- **Hormonal changes affect behavior and attention**
- **Independence testing, boundary pushing behaviors**
- **Second fear period around 6-8 months**
- **Sexual maturity impacts social dynamics**

**Adult Period (18 months - 8 years)**:
- **Personality stabilization, learned patterns solidify**
- **Continued learning capacity but slower acquisition**
- **Maintenance of established social relationships**
- **Environmental stability preferences increase**

**Senior Period (8+ years)**:
- **Cognitive changes, slower processing but deeper wisdom**
- **Adaptation to physical limitations and sensory changes**
- **Increased need for routine and environmental predictability**
- **Enhanced focus on comfort and quality of life**
- **Stronger human bonds, preference for familiar experiences**
- **Memory retention for established behaviors remains strong**

## Advanced Learning Theory

### Classical Conditioning Protocols
**Pavlovian Association Principles**:
- **Unconditioned Stimulus (US)**: Food, pain, pleasure (innate response)
- **Conditioned Stimulus (CS)**: Bell, word, visual cue (learned response)
- **Acquisition**: Repeated pairing strengthens association
- **Extinction**: CS without US weakens response
- **Spontaneous Recovery**: Extinct responses may reappear
- **Generalization**: Similar stimuli trigger same response
- **Discrimination**: Different stimuli trigger different responses

**Training Applications**:
- Create positive associations with training equipment
- Counter-condition fear responses to triggers
- Build enthusiastic responses to recall cues
- Establish calm responses to grooming/handling

### Operant Conditioning Mastery
**Thorndike's Law of Effect Applications**:
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Add something pleasant (R+ = treat after sit)
- **Negative Reinforcement**: Remove something unpleasant (R- = pressure release)
- **Positive Punishment**: Add something unpleasant (P+ = verbal correction)
- **Negative Punishment**: Remove something pleasant (P- = time-out from play)

**Reinforcement Schedule Science**:
- **Continuous**: Every response rewarded (acquisition phase)
- **Fixed Ratio**: Every nth response rewarded (predictable pattern)
- **Variable Ratio**: Random response rewards (gambling effect, strongest)
- **Fixed Interval**: Time-based rewards (weak maintenance)
- **Variable Interval**: Random time rewards (steady performance)

### Cognitive Ethology Principles
**Problem-Solving Capabilities**:
- **Insight Learning**: Sudden understanding without trial-and-error
- **Latent Learning**: Knowledge acquired without immediate demonstration
- **Observational Learning**: Imitation of behaviors from observation
- **Spatial Memory**: Mental mapping of territories and resources

**Communication Intelligence**:
- **Referential Signals**: Specific barks for different situations
- **Intentional Communication**: Deliberate attempts to influence humans
- **Theory of Mind**: Understanding human attention and intentions
- **Emotional Contagion**: Mirroring human emotional states

## Behavioral Assessment Framework

### Temperament Testing Protocols
**Volhard Puppy Aptitude Test Adaptations**:
- **Social Attraction**: Response to human approach and calling
- **Following**: Willingness to follow human movement
- **Restraint**: Reaction to being held on back
- **Social Dominance**: Response to petting and stroking
- **Elevation**: Comfort level when lifted off ground
- **Retrieving**: Interest in chasing and returning objects
- **Touch Sensitivity**: Pain threshold and reaction intensity
- **Sound Sensitivity**: Response to sudden loud noises
- **Sight Sensitivity**: Reaction to moving visual stimuli
- **Stability**: Recovery time from startling experiences

### Energy Level Categories (Expanded)
**Working Drive Assessment**:
- **Prey Drive**: Chasing, capturing instincts (herding breeds high)
- **Pack Drive**: Social cooperation, following leadership
- **Defense Drive**: Protective responses, territorial behaviors
- **Food Drive**: Motivation for food rewards and resource guarding

**Activity Requirements**:
- **High Energy (Border Collie type)**: 90+ minutes intense activity daily
- **Moderate-High (Labs, Retrievers)**: 60-90 minutes varied activity
- **Moderate (Bulldogs, Basset Hounds)**: 30-60 minutes gentle exercise
- **Low Energy (Senior dogs, Pugs)**: 15-30 minutes short sessions

### Stress and Arousal Management
**Stress Response Physiology**:
- **Acute Stress**: Heightened alertness, improved performance (eustress)
- **Chronic Stress**: Cortisol elevation, learning impairment (distress)
- **Threshold Management**: Keep arousal below overwhelm point
- **Recovery Protocols**: Allow decompression between sessions

**Calming Signal Recognition (Turid Rugaas System)**:
- **Displacement Behaviors**: Yawning, lip licking, scratching when not itchy
- **Avoidance Signals**: Looking away, turning head/body, moving slowly
- **Appeasement Gestures**: Play bow, lowered body posture, soft eyes
- **Distance-Increasing Signals**: Freezing, stiffening, direct stare

**Arousal Indicators**:
- **Under-Aroused**: Sluggish responses, low motivation, disengagement
- **Optimal Arousal**: Alert but calm, focused attention, eager participation
- **Over-Aroused**: Hyperactive, unable to focus, impulsive behaviors
- **Threshold Exceeded**: Reactive, explosive responses, learning shutdown

## Species-Specific Behavior Patterns

### Breed Psychology Considerations
**Herding Breeds (Border Collie, Australian Shepherd)**:
- **Eye Contact**: Intense staring as herding tool, may seem confrontational
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Strong reactions to movement, chasing instincts
- **Workaholic Tendencies**: Difficulty with "off" switches, need mental jobs
- **Problem-Solving Drive**: High intelligence, need complex challenges

**Terrier Breeds (Jack Russell, Bull Terrier)**:
- **Prey Drive**: High chase and capture instincts, independent hunting
- **Tenacity**: Persistent, determined personality, strong will
- **Earth Dog Instincts**: Digging, going to ground behaviors
- **Quick Reactions**: Fast decision-making, impulsive responses

**Guardian Breeds (German Shepherd, Rottweiler)**:
- **Territorial Instincts**: Property and family protection drives
- **Stranger Wariness**: Natural suspicion, need careful socialization
- **Loyalty Bonds**: Deep attachment to family, slower to trust outsiders
- **Authority Recognition**: Respect hierarchy, need confident leadership

**Scent Hounds (Beagle, Bloodhound)**:
- **Olfactory Dominance**: Nose rules brain, easily distracted by scents
- **Trail Independence**: Bred to work away from handler, self-directed
- **Vocal Communication**: Baying and howling as working signals
- **Persistence**: Once on trail, difficult to redirect attention

### Communication System Mastery
**Vocal Communications**:
- **Barking Patterns**: Alert, demand, play, stress, territorial vocalizations
- **Whining/Whimpering**: Anxiety, excitement, attention-seeking, pain
- **Growling**: Warning signal, play invitation, resource guarding
- **Howling**: Pack communication, environmental response, attention-seeking

**Body Language Fluency**:
- **Tail Positions**: Height indicates confidence, movement shows emotional state
- **Ear Positions**: Forward (alert), back (submissive), pinned (fearful/aggressive)
- **Eye Contact**: Direct stare (challenge), soft eyes (affection), avoidance (stress)
- **Body Posture**: Forward lean (confident), crouch (fearful), side presentation (calming)

**Scent Communication**:
- **Marking Behaviors**: Territory establishment, information exchange
- **Anal Gland Expressions**: Stress responses, social identification
- **Pheromone Sensitivity**: Chemical communication affects behavior
- **Scent Investigation**: Social networking through environmental odors
