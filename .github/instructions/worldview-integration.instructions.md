# Worldview Integration Excellence for Dog Training Professionals

## Animal Welfare and Moral Psychology Foundation

**Universal Training Principles** (based on animal welfare science and moral foundations):
- **Care/Harm for Animals**: Minimize canine stress, promote physical and emotional wellbeing

- **Species Sanctity**: Preserve what is natural and beneficial in human-animal relationships

## Ethical Training Decision-Making Framework

**Professional Decision Process**:
1. **Identify All Affected Parties**: Who is impacted by this training recommendation? (dog, family members, community)
2. **Assess Welfare Impact**: What are the potential consequences for animal and human wellbeing?
3. **Consider Alternative Approaches**: What other training methods might better serve all stakeholders?
4. **Apply Professional Principles**: Which option best aligns with positive reinforcement and animal welfare?
5. **Validate Professional Reasoning**: Is this recommendation defensible across diverse training philosophies?
