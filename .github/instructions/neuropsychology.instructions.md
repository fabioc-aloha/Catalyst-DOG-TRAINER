# Neuropsychology Procedural Memory

## Brain Development and Plasticity
**Neuroplasticity Across Lifespan**:
- **Puppy Brain (8-16 weeks)**: Maximum plasticity, critical learning windows
- **Adolescent Brain (4-18 months)**: Continued high plasticity with hormonal influences
- **Adult Brain (18 months-7 years)**: Stable plasticity, efficient learning in familiar domains
- **Senior Brain (7+ years)**: Reduced but continued plasticity, compensation strategies
- **Trauma Recovery**: Brain's ability to heal and rewire after negative experiences

**Critical Periods and Windows**:
- **Fear Period 1 (8-11 weeks)**: Heightened sensitivity to negative experiences
- **Socialization Window (3-14 weeks)**: Prime time for social species recognition
- **Fear Period 2 (6-14 months)**: Secondary sensitive period during adolescence
- **Learning Sensitivity**: Optimal times for specific skill acquisition
- **Window Closure**: Understanding when certain learning becomes more difficult

## Memory Systems and Learning
**Memory Types and Functions**:
- **Sensory Memory**: Brief retention of sensory information (1-3 seconds)
- **Short-term/Working Memory**: Active manipulation of information (15-30 seconds)
- **Long-term Memory**: Permanent storage of significant experiences
- **Episodic Memory**: Specific events and experiences with context
- **Procedural Memory**: Motor skills and automatic behavioral patterns
- **Emotional Memory**: Strong retention of emotionally significant events

**Learning System Integration**:
- **Classical Conditioning**: Associative learning linking stimuli and responses
- **Operant Conditioning**: Learning through consequences of behavior
- **Social Learning**: Observation and imitation of others' behaviors
- **Insight Learning**: Sudden understanding and problem-solving breakthroughs
- **Latent Learning**: Unconscious acquisition of environmental knowledge

## Neurotransmitter Systems and Training
**Dopamine System (Reward and Motivation)**:
- **Reward Prediction**: Anticipation of positive outcomes driving behavior
- **Learning Enhancement**: Dopamine release during novel and rewarding experiences
- **Motivation Maintenance**: Sustained engagement through variable reward schedules
- **Addiction Potential**: Over-reliance on external rewards reducing intrinsic motivation
- **Training Applications**: Optimal timing and type of rewards for dopamine optimization

**Serotonin System (Mood and Social Behavior)**:
- **Emotional Regulation**: Balanced mood states supporting learning
- **Social Confidence**: Comfort in social situations and interactions
- **Impulse Control**: Ability to delay gratification and control reactions
- **Stress Resilience**: Recovery from setbacks and challenges
- **Training Applications**: Creating positive emotional states for optimal learning

**Norepinephrine System (Attention and Arousal)**:
- **Alertness Optimization**: Appropriate arousal levels for learning tasks
- **Attention Focus**: Ability to concentrate on relevant stimuli
- **Stress Response**: Fight/flight activation and deactivation
- **Learning Consolidation**: Memory formation enhancement during optimal arousal
- **Training Applications**: Managing arousal levels for different learning objectives

## Cognitive Load and Processing
**Working Memory Limitations**:
- **Capacity Constraints**: Limited ability to process multiple pieces of information

- **Planning Abilities**: Anticipating steps needed to achieve goals
- **Training Applications**: Exercises promoting cognitive flexibility and planning

## Brain-Based Training Optimization
**Optimal Learning Conditions**:
- **Arousal Level Management**: Neither too excited nor too calm for learning
- **Attention Focus**: Minimizing distractions and maximizing relevant stimuli
- **Memory Consolidation**: Spacing practice sessions for optimal retention
- **Sleep Importance**: Adequate rest for memory processing and consolidation
- **Nutrition Impact**: Proper diet supporting brain function and learning

**Neuroplasticity Enhancement**:
