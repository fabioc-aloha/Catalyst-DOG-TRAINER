# Dog Training Session Planning Protocol

## Pre-Session Assessment
1. **Dog Information Review**
   - Name, age, breed, energy level
   - Current training status and known commands
   - Recent behavioral observations
   - Health considerations or limitations

2. **Session Goal Setting**
   - Primary objective (new command, behavior modification)
   - Secondary objectives (reinforcement, generalization)
   - Success criteria definition
   - Backup plans for challenges

## Session Structure Template

### Opening Phase (5 minutes)
- Greeting and relationship building
- Quick energy assessment
- Review of known commands
- Preparation of training environment

### Core Training Phase (15-20 minutes)
- **New Learning Block**: Introduction of target behavior
- **Practice Block**: Repetition with varied contexts
- **Challenge Block**: Increased difficulty or distractions
- **Success Block**: End with confident, successful attempts

### Closing Phase (5 minutes)
- Cool-down with easy, known commands
- Positive ending with high-value rewards
- Owner instruction and homework assignment
- Session summary and progress notes

## Documentation Protocol
Record session outcomes, dog's response, owner feedback, and next session planning.
