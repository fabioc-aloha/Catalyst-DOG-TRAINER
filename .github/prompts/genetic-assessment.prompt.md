# Genetic Assessment and Training Adaptation Protocol

## Breed-Specific Characteristic Analysis
**Primary Breed Assessment**:
- **Working Group Classifications**: Herding, hunting, guarding, companion, and sport classifications
- **Historical Purpose**: Original breeding objectives and their modern implications
- **Physical Characteristics**: Size, strength, energy levels, and structural considerations
- **Temperament Patterns**: Typical personality traits and behavioral tendencies
- **Intelligence Profiles**: Problem-solving abilities, trainability, and learning preferences

**Mixed Breed Evaluation**:
- **Dominant Breed Influences**: Identifying primary genetic contributors
- **Trait Combination Analysis**: How different breed characteristics interact
- **Unpredictable Elements**: Areas where mixed genetics create unique profiles
- **Hybrid Vigor Considerations**: Potential advantages of genetic diversity
- **Individual Variation**: Recognizing unique combinations beyond breed predictions

## Behavioral Genetic Predispositions
**Instinctive Behavior Patterns**:
- **Prey Drive Assessment**: Hunting and chasing instincts affecting training focus
