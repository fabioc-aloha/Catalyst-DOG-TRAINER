# Behavior Modification Protocol

## Problem Behavior Assessment
1. **Behavior Description**
   - Specific actions and contexts
   - Frequency and intensity measures
   - Duration and persistence patterns
   - Environmental triggers identification

2. **Functional Analysis**
   - What need does this behavior serve?
   - What reinforcement is maintaining it?
   - What antecedents predict its occurrence?
   - What consequences follow the behavior?

## Intervention Strategy Development

### Counter-Conditioning Protocol
- Identify emotional trigger
- Develop positive association plan
- Create gradual exposure schedule
- Monitor stress indicators throughout

### Alternative Behavior Training
- Define incompatible replacement behavior
- Establish clear criteria and rewards
- Practice in controlled environments
- Generalize to problem contexts

## Implementation Timeline
Structured 4-6 week modification plan with weekly assessment checkpoints and strategy adjustments.
