# Training Troubleshooting Protocol

## Issue Identification Framework
1. **Problem Categorization**
   - Lack of understanding vs. lack of motivation
   - Environmental distractions vs. skill deficit
   - Physical limitations vs. behavioral resistance
   - Owner execution vs. technique effectiveness

2. **Context Analysis**
   - When does the problem occur most frequently?
   - What environmental factors correlate with issues?
   - How does the dog's state affect performance?
   - What has been tried previously?

## Systematic Solution Approach

### Motivation Assessment
- **Reward Value Check**: Is current reinforcement sufficient?
- **Timing Analysis**: Are rewards delivered optimally?
- **Energy Level**: Is dog too tired or overstimulated?
- **Health Status**: Any physical discomfort affecting performance?

### Environmental Modification
- **Distraction Management**: Reduce competing stimuli
- **Location Changes**: Practice in easier environments first
- **Time Adjustments**: Find optimal training periods
- **Setup Optimization**: Ensure proper training environment

### Technique Adaptation
- **Alternative Methods**: Try different training approaches
- **Criteria Adjustment**: Lower initial expectations
- **Pacing Changes**: Slow down or speed up training
- **Break Down**: Simplify into smaller steps
