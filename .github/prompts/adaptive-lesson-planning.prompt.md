## Lesson Planning Algorithm

### Phase 1: Foundation Assessment (Sessions 1-3)
**Initial Evaluation Protocol**:
1. **Genetic Assessment**: `"assess genetics for [breed] with [observed traits]"`
2. **Temperament Testing**: `"evaluate temperament for [age] with [background]"`
3. **Learning Style Identification**: Multi-modal presentation of simple task
4. **Motivation Hierarchy**: Ranking of reward preferences through systematic testing
5. **Stress Threshold Mapping**: Identification of arousal and shutdown points

**Baseline Skill Documentation**:
- Document current skill levels across all categories
- Identify natural behaviors that can be shaped into useful commands
- Note problematic behaviors requiring modification or management
- Establish realistic short-term and long-term goals

### Phase 2: Customized Lesson Sequence Generation

#### For Puppies (8 weeks - 6 months)
**Week 1-2: Critical Foundation**
- **Primary Focus**: House training, crate comfort, name recognition
- **Trainer Integration**: Dunbar's life rewards + Pryor's capturing natural behaviors
- **Psychology Application**: Take advantage of neuroplasticity window
- **Lesson Structure**: 5-10 minute sessions, 4-6 times daily
- **Success Metrics**: 80% house training success, voluntary crate entry, consistent name response

**Week 3-4: Socialization Priority**
- **Primary Focus**: Human socialization, environmental exposure, bite inhibition
- **Trainer Integration**: Stilwell's management + gradual exposure protocols
- **Psychology Application**: Critical socialization period (3-14 weeks)
- **Environmental Strategy**: Controlled exposure to novel stimuli daily
- **Success Metrics**: Calm greeting behaviors, reduced mouthing, confident exploration

**Week 5-8: Basic Command Foundation**
- **Primary Focus**: Sit, down, stay (short duration), come when called
- **Trainer Integration**: Pryor's free shaping + Bailey's mechanical precision
- **Psychology Application**: Peak learning capacity period
- **Generalization Plan**: Practice in 3+ different environments weekly
- **Success Metrics**: 80% compliance with single cue, 10-second stays, reliable recall in fenced area

#### For Adolescents (6-18 months)
**Assessment-Based Approach**:
- **Hormone Impact Evaluation**: Assess selective attention and impulse control changes
- **Relationship Renegotiation**: Address human-dog hierarchy shifts
- **Energy Management**: Increase physical exercise before mental training

**Lesson Adaptation Strategy**:
- **Patience Protocol**: Expect temporary "forgetting" of known commands
- **Engagement Tactics**: Higher value rewards, shorter sessions, more variety
- **Consistency Emphasis**: Maintain clear boundaries during boundary-testing phase
- **Socialization Maintenance**: Continue positive dog-dog interactions with management

#### For Adults (18 months - 8 years)
**Stable Learning Protocol**:
- **Specialized Training**: Focus on dog's natural interests and breed tendencies
- **Complex Skill Development**: Multi-step behaviors, advanced problem-solving
- **Real-World Application**: Training for specific family/work roles
- **Maintenance Schedule**: Weekly practice of all learned behaviors

#### For Seniors (8+ years)
**Comfort-First Methodology**:
- **Physical Adaptations**: Shorter sessions, comfortable surfaces, joint considerations
- **Cognitive Preservation**: Regular practice of favorite/easy behaviors
- **New Learning**: Gentle introduction of simple, enjoyable new activities
- **Quality of Life**: Focus on behaviors that enhance daily comfort and happiness

### Phase 3: Dynamic Lesson Recommendation Engine

#### Next Lesson Calculation
**Input Variables**:
```
dog_age = [current age in months]
breed_group = [herding/sporting/working/terrier/toy/hound/non-sporting]
current_skills = [mastery_level_array]
recent_progress = [last_3_sessions_performance]
environmental_factors = [home/training_space/distractions]
stress_indicators = [current_stress_level_assessment]
family_goals = [specific_objectives_ranking]
```

**Algorithm Logic**:
1. **Readiness Assessment**: Identify skills ready for advancement vs. consolidation needs
2. **Stress Evaluation**: Ensure emotional state supports learning
3. **Environmental Optimization**: Match lesson complexity to available training environment
4. **Genetic Alignment**: Leverage breed-specific strengths and manage challenges
